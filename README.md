# Delaunay Triangulation for Processing
A basic Delaunay Triangulation library for Processing.

## Test Applet
This project comes with a test applet for (surprise!) testing the triangulation code.
The controls are as follows:
* Mouse click: add points to be triangulated
* "ENTER" key: triangulate the points and take a screenshot; you should clear all points using "x" before restarting
* "x" key: clear the screen and all points
